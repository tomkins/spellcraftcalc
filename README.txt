Woe be to all who venture here...

For linux (fedora) the following packages seem to work;

  python
  python-devel
  python-4Suite-XML
  qt4
  qt4-x11
  qt4-devel
  sip
  sip-devel
  PyQt4
  PyQt4-devel
  
The -devel packages may or may not be required, let us know if all is
well without one or more of them.
