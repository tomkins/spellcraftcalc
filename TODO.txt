Urgent things to fix before next beta release!!!

  Options does not open with the first options page - ugly.

  Selecting the menu DOES NOT TRIGGER editingFinished!  Damn TT.
  Causes worrysome side effects.

Things to fix before next beta release is announced;

  Allow users to choose the Realm (or 'All') for items, drop and crafted.
  (Crafted items all have a specific realm, even on Gaheris/Mordred, while
  drop items can be 'All/Any'.)

  Fix Classic Windows skin view of Group boxes (XP is fine, Mac and X11
  are now working correctly).

  Prettify the display of stats with caps for the screen, with
  a stat/maxstat flavor option.  Rebalance between two or three rows
  of resists and bonuses to shorten the screen again after AF & PP%.
  OR - Drop the three or four acuity stats that "don't apply" for
  a given class, unless they have a bonus present?

  Allow users to choose to include class-specific bonuses for resists
  (mostly, applies to heavy tanks).

  Test our UI XML results (can we avoid double-xslt transformations?)
  
  Add 'materials' to SCTemplate XML report, perhaps per-item and 
  per-template?  Or per-gem, then sum them?

  Allow Drop Effect slots to have any value (such as a 5.1 DS effect
  or 64/5 DoT effect), not just pure integers.

  Add lookup of Drop tincture effects (from epic dungeons) for crafted gear.
  According to various searchs of alakazahm and the the autobestiary,
  Prissy's lists were complete.

  Add 1.85 tincture effects for crafted gear.  Means we have to tear
  apart the tables because the levels don't 'just line up'.  We have
  lv 43 and 45 netherium and lv 47 and 49 arcanium procs depending 
  on the name of the proc and the drop ablative lv 48 has the same
  effect name as the crafted (different amounts).

  Fill in the Requirement field with the proc level requirement.

Things to fix before 2.0 final (non-beta) is announced;

  Add 1.85-1.87 crafted slot lookups (by realm/style/piece).

  Add Mythrian bonuses - especially over-cap logic!

  Show Bonuses of % as #% finally?

  Let slots share an Item list, e.g. both Left Ring and Right Ring
  keep track of the same unused Rings.  "Move to" sort of provides this,
  but not very elegantly.

  A guildy suggested that the user could fix all of the body armor
  pieces or all the weapons which are crafted, based on popping up
  the itemlevel window only once (cool!!!)  Something similar for item 
  quality?  Or a Copy drop menu to fill one other slot, all armor,
  all (four) weapons, or all gems (for quick-lv 51)?

  Fill in Bonus based on itemlevel dialog, when known from material level.  

  Calculate Piece Ablative as an average based on chance-to-hit-body-part.

  List Reactive Effects ordered by %chance to hit body part?

  Can we make the 'editing' flavor of the dropdown controls line up
  with their look when they are in drop-pick only mode on Mac?  They
  seem off by -3,-1 (x,y) pixels and offsized -4,-1 or so.  Or just
  blame trolltech?  How about the corresponding pure-edit controls so
  they line up, too?
