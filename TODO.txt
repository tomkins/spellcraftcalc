Things to fix before next beta release is announced;

  Stop displaying unused slots in the reports!

  Calculate 5th slot proc by level requirement.

  Add 5th slot Drop tinctures (from epic dungeons) for crafted gear.
  According to various searchs of alakazahm and the the autobestiary,
  Prissy's lists are (were) complete.

  Add 1.85 Crafted armor lookups (by realm/style/piece)


Things to fix before 2.0 final (non-beta) is announced;

  Let slots share an Item list, e.g. both Left Ring and Right Ring
  keep track of unused Rings.  Move to sort of provides this, but 
  not all that elegantly.

  LoadTemplate:  Some report that old templates don't load properly.
  Noticed more often on crafted rather than drop gear, probably bad
  lookups.  Good fix would be to scream bloody murder during the load
  to sys.stderr so the user can give us a log.

  Accelerator keys to jump around the page, especially to tabs.


Extreme features, perhaps post-2.0

  A guildy suggested that the user could fix all of the body armor
  pieces or all the weapons which are crafted, based on popping up
  the itemlevel window only once (cool!!!)  Something similar for item 
  quality?  Or a Copy drop menu to fill one other slot, all armor,
  all (four) weapons, or all gems (for quick-lv 51)?

  Fill in AF/DPS based on itemlevel dialog, if provided.  Perhaps
  even bonus, when known by material level.  

  Calculate Piece Ablative as an average based on chance-to-hit-body-part.
