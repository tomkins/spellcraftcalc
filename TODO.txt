Things to fix before next beta release is announced;

  Test our UI XML results (can we avoid double-xslt followed by our
  custom rewriting?)

  Add an option between 'expected cost' v.s. cost of single gem.

  Fix the GroupBox to frames with GroupBox looks (for Mac which hates
  unnamed group boxes).

  Can we make the 'editing' flavor of the dropdown controls line up
  with their look when they are in drop-pick only mode on Mac?

  Add Drop tincture effects (from epic dungeons) for crafted gear.
  According to various searchs of alakazahm and the the autobestiary,
  Prissy's lists were complete.

  Add 1.85 tincture effects for crafted gear.  Means we have to tear
  apart the tables because the levels don't 'just line up'.  We have
  lv 43 and 45 netherium and lv 47 and 49 arcanium procs depending 
  on the name of the proc and the drop ablative lv 48 has the same
  effect name as the crafted (different amounts).

  Calculate 5th slot proc by level requirement.

  Add 1.85 crafted slot armor lookups (by realm/style/piece).

  Prettify the display of stats with caps for reports and the screen,
  with a stat/maxstat flavor option.

  Allow users to choose to include class-specific bonuses for resists
  (mostly, applies to heavy tanks).

  Drop Amount can't be a decimal (such as 6.1 Dmg Shield effect).  999.9
  seems like a better template.

  Translate Eitharg's 'PvE' item Type -> 'PvE Bonus', some of the specific
  bonuses need to be added to the fixup table, and -1's in some fields
  should become blank amounts.

Things to fix before 2.0 final (non-beta) is announced;

  Show Bonuses of % as #% at last?

  Blend Power and Hits into the "Stats" list finally?  Our Type dropdown
  has grown somewhat long.

  Deal with Mythical slot items, however those go live in the game.

  Let slots share an Item list, e.g. both Left Ring and Right Ring
  keep track of the same unused Rings.  "Move to" sort of provides this,
  but not very elegantly.

  A guildy suggested that the user could fix all of the body armor
  pieces or all the weapons which are crafted, based on popping up
  the itemlevel window only once (cool!!!)  Something similar for item 
  quality?  Or a Copy drop menu to fill one other slot, all armor,
  all (four) weapons, or all gems (for quick-lv 51)?

  Fill in Bonus based on itemlevel dialog, when known from material level.  

  Calculate Piece Ablative as an average based on chance-to-hit-body-part.
  Show Reactive Effects ordered by %chance to hit body part.
