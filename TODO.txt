Things to fix before next beta release is announced;

  Ensure we save/load PC and drop items (something was(?) wrong).

  Fix the prices, it's just wonked with all the different cost
  changes to gems since cats gems.  This means using SC.py from
  ScWindow.py instead of duplicating the code.

  Price (in addition to cost) per-item.

  Make a typeable combobox just works correctly, or offer a popup
  for users type in their own 'other bonus...', 'other effect...',
  requires unwinding the SearchableCombo a bit.  The code already
  handles this 'other...' custom named bonus just fine, it adds to
  the table of effects, temporarally.

  Stop saving unused slots in the template.xml?

  Stop displaying unused slots in the reports!

  Display 5th slot proc by level requirement.  Make it selectable?
  (E.g. choose an effect amount or the proc level).  There's room
  where the 'quality' on other gem slots isn't needed.


Things to fix before 2.0 final (non-beta) is announced;

  Untangle modified events ... gotta mop those up, so unchanged
  templates remain unchanged.  Perhaps use Item.py to track this,
  and compare with new/last saved details?

  Figure costing of crafted tinctures as a seperate subtotal,
  priced by their own rules, based on 94 qual (it doesn't matter).

  LoadTemplate:  Some report that old templates don't load properly.
  Noticed more often on crafted rather than drop gear, probably bad
  lookups.  Good fix would be to scream bloody murder during the load
  to sys.stderr so the user can give us a log.

  LoadTemplate:  Loading a template doesn't update the most recently
  used list, nor the directory to load templates from (saving does).
  At least ensure the template defaults to cwd()+'/templates/*.xml'

  LoadItem:  Is /very/ slow (populating the list, it's not in the
  preview, perhaps matching to the file extensions?), and doesn't 
  remember the directory used.

  Prevent user from choosing > tier 1 Finesse all magic/all melee 
  skills (the recent code for tinctures -should- make this a little
  bit easier, but not simple.)

  Accelerator keys to jump around the page, especially to tabs.


Extreme features, perhaps post-2.0

  Replace '[V] Equipped   (o) crafted   (o) drop' with a drop down of
  multiple items in the player's 'queue' based on slot.  Loading another
  item adds it to the selectable 'queue'.  'Crafted' is one choice, and
  perhaps user can add a second 'Crafted 2' or give them names.  The
  final choice is 'None' which does the same thing as 'unequipping'.
  The items in the drop down list are the item names.

  Add 'requirements' in general (beyond 5th crafted slot) for drop items
  by each gem slot.  Track 'Artifact Level' in this same field (none of
  them appear to be arti level + required level).  Such as, Spell Range
  - requirement against Animals, or Spell Range - requirement artifact
  level 50.

  A guildy suggested that the user could fix all of the body armor
  pieces or all the weapons which are crafted, based on popping up
  the itemlevel window only once (cool!!!)  Something similar for item 
  quality?  Or a Copy drop menu to fill one other slot, all armor,
  all (four) weapons, or all gems (for quick-lv 51)?

  Fill in AF/DPS based on itemlevel dialog, if provided.  Perhaps
  even bonus, when known by material level.  

  Calculate Piece Ablative as an average based on chance-to-hit-body-part.
