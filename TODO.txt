Things to fix before next release is announced;

  Just make sure the blinking switch from player to drop and back
  doesn't mess up someones crafted gear.  It's good to move the
  stats when they started entering the wrong kind of gear, and
  to 'almost' copy a drop item.

Things to fix before 2.0 final (non-beta) is announced;

  LoadTemplate:  Some report that old templates don't load properly.
  Noticed more often on crafted rather than drop gear, probably bad
  lookups.  Good fix would be to scream bloody murder during the load
  to sys.stderr so the user can give us a log.

  LoadTemplate:  Loading a template doesn't update the most recently
  used list, nor the directory to load templates from.  At least
  ensure the template defaults to cwd()+'/templates/*.xml'

  LoadItem:  Is /very/ slow (populating the list, it's not in the
  preview, perhaps matching to the file extensions), and doesn't 
  remember the directory used.

  A guildy suggested that the user could fix all of the body armor
  pieces or all the weapons which are crafted, based on popping up
  the itemlevel window only once (cool!!!)  Something similar for 
  item quality?  Or a Copy drop menu to fill one other slot, all armor,
  all (four) weapons, or all gems (for quick-lv 51)?

  Fill in AF/DPS based on itemlevel dialog, if provided.  Perhaps
  even bonus, when known by material level.  

  Move the magic choose-realm to the main window from options.

  Untangle modified events ... gotta mop those up, so unchanged
  templates remain unchanged.  Perhaps use Item.py to track this?

  Calculate Piece Ablative as an average based on chance-to-hit-body-part.

  Accelerator keys for tabs, and other things.  Add up/down arrow
  behavior to tab bar (to jump rows quickly).

  DisplayWindow:  Will sometimes show a bonus for slot '' (empty) 
  pointing at nothing, al la [: 3] (double-counting a listed slot?)
  Unsure if this is still a bug.

  Make a typeable combobox just work correctly, or offer a popup
  for users type in their own 'other bonus...', 'other effect...',
  requires unwinding the SearchableCombo a bit.

  Merge in the Effects development branch;

    Figure costing of crafted tinctures as a seperate subtotal,
    price by SC markup rules but base on 94 qual (it doesn't matter).
    Make sure 5th player slot saves/loads.
