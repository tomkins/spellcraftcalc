Things to fix before next beta release is announced;

  Stop displaying unused slots in the reports!

  Fix ESC key behavior when used to cancel the combobox item list popup.

  Provide a dialog to choose the the root of the user's items\ directory
  tree (already is stored in Spellcraft.xml)

  Calculate 5th slot proc by level requirement.

  Add 5th slot Drop tinctures (from epic dungeons) for crafted gear.
  According to various searchs of alakazahm and the the autobestiary,
  Prissy's lists are (were) complete.

  Add 1.85 Crafted armor lookups (by realm/style/piece)

  Prettify the display of stats with caps for reports.

  Allow users to choose to include class-specific bonuses for resists
  (mostly, applies to heavy tanks).


Things to fix before 2.0 final (non-beta) is announced;

  Let slots share an Item list, e.g. both Left Ring and Right Ring
  keep track of the same unused Rings.  "Move to" sort of provides this,
  but not very elegantly.

  A guildy suggested that the user could fix all of the body armor
  pieces or all the weapons which are crafted, based on popping up
  the itemlevel window only once (cool!!!)  Something similar for item 
  quality?  Or a Copy drop menu to fill one other slot, all armor,
  all (four) weapons, or all gems (for quick-lv 51)?

  Fill in Bonus based on itemlevel dialog, when known from material level.  

  Calculate Piece Ablative as an average based on chance-to-hit-body-part.
