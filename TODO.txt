Things to fix before next release is announced;

  LoadTemplate:  Some report that old templates don't load properly.
  Noticed more often on crafted rather than drop gear, probably bad
  lookups.  Good fix would be to scream bloody murder during the load
  to sys.stderr so the user can give us a log.

  LoadTemplate:  Loading a template doesn't update the most recently
  used list, nor the directory to load templates from.

  LoadItem:  Is /very/ slow (trying item preview for everything in the
  whole list?), and doesn't remember the directory used.


Things to fix before 2.0 final (non-beta) is announced;

  A guildy suggested that the user could fix all of the body armor
  pieces or all the weapons which are crafted, based on popping up
  the itemlevel window only once (cool!!!)  Something similar for 
  item quality?

  Fill in AF/DPS based on itemlevel dialog, if provided.  Perhaps
  even bonus, when known by material level.  

  Move the magic choose-realm to the main window from options.

  Damned modified = 1 events ... gotta mop those up, keep unchanged
  templates unmodified.

  Calculate Piece Ablative as an average based on chance-to-hit-body-part.

  Clean up some messy graphics on the tab buttons.

  Accelerator keys for tabs.

  DisplayWindow:  Will sometimes show a bonus for slot '' (empty) 
  pointing at nothing, al la [: 3] (double-counting a listed slot?)

  Merge in the Effects development branch;

    Make the typeable combobox just work correctly.
    Let users type in their own 'other effects...'
    Figure costing of crafted tinctures as a seperate subtotal,
    price by SC markup rules.
