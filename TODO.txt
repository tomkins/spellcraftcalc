Things to fix before next beta release is announced;

  Reimplement the MultiTabBar for Q4, if possible, or find another
  representation for selecting a slot.

  Unhook the old Q3FileDialog/Q3FilePreview model for a customized
  QFileDialog with "Load Item" Preview, if possible.

  Unhook the old Q3ListView model for the new Q4 list model for
  the CraftBar CharList, if possible.

  Promote Item.py attributes such as Name, Level, Bonus etc. into
  the per-item scope (for each drop, crafted, and other named items).

  Quit crashing when Tab bar / Drop list accelerator keys are
  pressed, while load item dialog is open.

  Fix the prices, it's just wonked with all the different cost
  changes to gems since cats gems.  This means using SC.py from
  ScWindow.py instead of duplicating the code.

  Price (in addition to cost) per-item.

  Stop displaying unused slots in the reports!

  Display 5th slot proc by level requirement.  Make it selectable?
  (E.g. choose an effect amount or the proc level).  There's room
  where the 'quality' on other gem slots isn't needed.

  Add 5th slot Drop tinctures (from epic dungeons) for crafted gear.
  According to various searchs of alakazahm and the the autobestiary,
  Prissy's lists are (were) complete.

  Add 1.85 Crafted armor bonuses (sixth slot becomes custom bonus?)

  Add 1.84 Crafted staves (sixth slot for Focus 50?)

  Add 1.84 Legendary Weapons (fourth slot 2% melee / magic / archery 
  damage bonus against All Monsters, fifth slot AF 10 / 50 All Focus, 
  sixth slot becomes selectable specific charges/proc effects)

Things to fix before 2.0 final (non-beta) is announced;

  Untangle modified events ... gotta mop those up, so unchanged
  templates remain unchanged.  Perhaps use Item.py to track this,
  and compare with new/last saved details?

  Figure costing of crafted tinctures as a seperate subtotal,
  priced by their own rules, based on 94 qual (it doesn't matter).

  LoadTemplate:  Some report that old templates don't load properly.
  Noticed more often on crafted rather than drop gear, probably bad
  lookups.  Good fix would be to scream bloody murder during the load
  to sys.stderr so the user can give us a log.

  LoadTemplate:  Loading a template doesn't update the most recently
  used list, nor the directory to load templates from (saving does).
  At least ensure the template defaults to cwd()+'/templates/*.xml'

  LoadItem:  Is /very/ slow (populating the list, it's not in the
  preview, perhaps matching to the file extensions?), and doesn't 
  remember the directory used.

  Accelerator keys to jump around the page, especially to tabs.


Extreme features, perhaps post-2.0

  Replace '[V] Equipped   (o) crafted   (o) drop' with a drop down of
  multiple items in the player's 'queue' based on slot.  Loading another
  item adds it to the selectable 'queue'.  'Crafted' is one choice, and
  perhaps user can add a second 'Crafted 2' or give them names.  The
  final choice is 'None' which does the same thing as 'unequipping'.
  The items in the drop down list are the item names.

  Add 'requirements' in general (beyond 5th crafted slot) for drop items
  by each gem slot.  Track 'Artifact Level' in this same field (none of
  them appear to be arti level + required level).  Such as, Spell Range
  - requirement against Animals, or Spell Range - requirement artifact
  level 50.

  A guildy suggested that the user could fix all of the body armor
  pieces or all the weapons which are crafted, based on popping up
  the itemlevel window only once (cool!!!)  Something similar for item 
  quality?  Or a Copy drop menu to fill one other slot, all armor,
  all (four) weapons, or all gems (for quick-lv 51)?

  Fill in AF/DPS based on itemlevel dialog, if provided.  Perhaps
  even bonus, when known by material level.  

  Calculate Piece Ablative as an average based on chance-to-hit-body-part.
