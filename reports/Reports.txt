Configurable Reports

My configurable reports work pretty much the same way as Leladia's.
The only caveat is that the file gets rendered as an HTML file.
So, in order to do line breaks, you must use <br />, but this allows you 
to use <table>, <hr />, etc... in your report to make it look really nice.

The available tags are:
<attribute #/>
Where attribute can be:
str con dex qui pie int hits power cha emp
body energy crush thrust slash cold matter heat spirit

And # is the field width, and it uses max(#, width of text) as the field width.
Of course, you don't really need this if you use <table>s everywhere, and you
don't export to text often.

And the trailing / in <something/> tells XML parsers the tag stands on it's own
(it doesn't have a matching </something> to close it).  These are not required!
But they are encouraged for every tag listed here, because some .xml editors 
will groan without them.

Note that good html style is encouraged.  Some browsers won't show <br/> and
<hr/> - but they must all correctly show <br /> and <hr />, so we just add the
extra space before the /> to close every unmatched html tag, for compatibility, 
clarity and style.

Focus Tags
Same as Leladia's:
<focus1> <focus2> <focus3> <focus4>

Also <foci>  - lists all the focuses on separate lines

Skill Tags
Same as Leladia's:
<skill#> so <skill1> <skill2> etc...
And <skills> - lists all the skills on separate lines

Other Bonus Tags
<otherbonuses> - lists all the Other Bonuses (from ToA/PvE) on separate lines

Cap Increase Tags
<capbonuses> - lists all the Cap Increase bonuses (from ToA) on separate lines

Piece/Jewelry tags:
These tags are of the form:
<location prop>
location can be one of:
chest arms head legs hands feet rweapon lweapon 2handed ranged
neck cloak jewel belt rring lring rwrist lwrist

prop can be one of:
name (drop only)
level
quality
bonus
af - this tag has a dual meaning (AF for armor and DPS for weapons)
utility
usedpoints (PC made only)
availablepoints (PC made only)
overcharge (PC made only)
<chest quality> <arms af> etc..

Gem/Effect tags:
<location gem# prop>
See above for location values

gem# can be: gem1 gem2 gem3 gem4 gem5 (and gem6 through gem10 for drop only)

prop can be:
quality (PC made only) - gem quality
amount - amount of bonus
name (PC made only) - name of the gem
effect - what stat/skill/etc
<chest gem1 amount> <chest gem1 name>, etc

Conditionals:
<if location pcmade>.......</if>
<if location drop>.........</if>
Report generation is based on which radio button, drop or player crafted,
that you have selected at time of the report.  The old <endif> instead of
</if> is still supported, but not recommended, as it isn't valid xml/sgml.

Also there is <ifnotempty location>.....<endif>
This excludes an item from printing in the config report if the slots are
all completed 'Unused'.  The old <endifnotempty> instead of </ifnotempty>
is still supported, but not recommended, as it isn't valid xml/sgml.

The default report file (which pretty much shows everything) is in: 
reports\Default_Config_Report.xml
